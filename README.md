You just need to tap on the button "Add Water" and your water glass will be added.
2. #### Delete Water Glass
   Deleting water glass means if we have added any glass of water mistakenly then we can delete it and keep our records clear and correct. There is an alert
after we click on delete button. That is because we may click the delete button mistakenly and we can correct our mistake.
3. #### Edit time
    This feature in our app located in home screen helps the user to change the time of glass of water that you drank. Because you may have added water glass
after some time of drinking water or something else.

time if you somehow forget.
7. #### Delete Reminders
   Delete reminders is a good feature if you want to correct your mistake instead of getting reminders unnecessarily.
8. #### Progress bar showing
    Showing a graph on your home screen is a very good feature telling you how much have you drank graphically instead of writing.
9. #### Intake goal completion percentage
    This feature is surely the same as showing a graph bar but not graphically. This shows you a percentage of how much have you completed.
10. #### Authentication
    Authentication plays a very important role in separating you from many others using same app. It also makes sure that no one is able to access your 
personal data
